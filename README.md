# express-api-template

**_A base API template for a REST API using express._**

</div>

## Philosophy

Setting up a new project can be a long and tedious process, especially when you want to jump to building out
your idea. This template will provide you with the tools you need to start creating your REST API without the
pain of copying files from other projects or using a bloated framework. We've packed a lot of utilities into
the template, which are much needed tools to aid the development of an organized application. We recommend
reading the guide below before starting â€” so you have a valuable understanding of how to navigate around the
project.

# Technologies

We've built this project using minimal packages to cover everything an API should be able to do. Here's a list
of the technologies used in the template:

#### Packages

-   Express (web framework)
-   Winston (logger)
-   IORedis (redis provider)
-   Prisma (database provider)
-   Joi (validation)

#### Linting and Formatting

-   Typescript
-   Prettier
-   ESLint

#### Tools

-   Redis
-   PostgreSQL
-   Docker
-   Docker Compose
